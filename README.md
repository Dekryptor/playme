PlayMe is an unofficial YouTube Music desktop app with some additional features. 

Why? So that you can enjoy your YouTube Music on desktop, without having to worry about the browser tab which plays it now.

How does it work?
---------
It's a basic Electron WebView with Youtube Music. on top of that, additional system functionalities were added. The idea is not to use the Youtube API, but instead, to re-use the original youtube music functionality. 

Features:
---------
* Handle Media Keys: Play/Pause, Next, Previous
* Responsive Window
